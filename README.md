# Oauth2-Proxy

OAuth2-Proxy is an open-source reverse proxy tool that provides authentication and authorization capabilities between OAuth 2.0-protected applications and resources. It is based on the OAuth 2.0 protocol, making it easier and more secure to integrate OAuth 2.0 authentication into applications.

The main functionality of OAuth2-Proxy is to separate user authentication and authorization processes from the application logic. It acts as an intermediary, receiving requests from client applications and interacting with the authentication server using the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It handles authentication flows such as the authorization code flow or implicit flow, obtains access tokens, and then forwards requests to the actual resource server.
